# Full Stack Open — University of Helsinki (Parts 0–9)

This repository contains my completed exercises and projects for the **Full Stack Open** course by the University of Helsinki. The course focuses on modern JavaScript-based web development, covering both frontend and backend technologies with an emphasis on React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, testing, and TypeScript.

All parts are included in this repository **except Part 3**, which is hosted separately due to deployment requirements.

## 📚 Course Overview

Full Stack Open is a comprehensive course that covers:

- Modern React with hooks  
- RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express  
- Working with MongoDB and Mongoose  
- State management with Redux and React Query  
- Testing with Jest and Supertest  
- CI/CD and deployment
